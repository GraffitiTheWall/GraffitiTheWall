- 👋 Hi, I’m Sereen, or @GraffitiTheWall!
- 👀 As you can see, I really like to code! I am a bit of a begginer, however, I'd appreciate it if you'd take the time to look at the projects I've made and give me some feedback!
- 💞️ I am really interested in game development, so if you're creating any games at the moment or looking for any new ideas, please consider collaberating with me.
- 📫 My email is tigergirl075@gmail.com if you ever want to reach out. Sometimes I'm, a bit busy but I'll reply as soon as I can :)
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her.
